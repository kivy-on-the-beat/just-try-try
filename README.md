just take a try

This code reads in an image file named “R-C.jpg”, converts it to grayscale and applies an adaptive threshold. It then finds contours in this binary image and selects one with largest area. A rectangle is drawn around this contour and it is cropped out from original image. The final result is displayed.

The code uses OpenCV and NumPy libraries for image processing and manipulation.
